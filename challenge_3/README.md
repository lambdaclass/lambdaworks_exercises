# It is over 9000!

The Saiyans have landed on planet earth. Our great defenders  Krillin, Piccolo, Tien and Gohan
have to hold on till Goku arrives on the scene.

Vegeta and Nappa have scouters that indicate our heroes power levels
and sadly we are not doing too well.

Somehow, Gohan has raised his power level to `p_4(X) = 9000`, but it is not good enough. Piccolo `p_3(X)` can help but he is still regenerating, and Krillin `p_2(X)` and Tien `p_1(X)` are in bad shape. The total power of the team is computed as  
```
P = p_1(X) * 0 + p_2(X) * 0 + p_3(X) * 0 + p_4(X)
```  
At the current moment, the X is equal to `42`.

Suddenly Gohan, and Piccolo recieve a message from Bulma that the scouters verify the sensed power level of individual enemies using KZG and for multiple enemies with batched KZG method. Vegeta knows for sure that the power level of Gohan is `p_4(X) = 9000`, so he will know if we change that. If only the team had a way to trick their opponents to believe that their total power level is `P > 9000` - then the enemies will surely flee.
